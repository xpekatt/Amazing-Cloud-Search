Amazing Cloud Search - C# API For Amazon Cloud Search - API-2013
============

Allow you to search, faceted search, add, update, remove objects from your Amazon Cloud Search Index in C#.
This is forked from [martin magakians beta 2013 api branch](https://github.com/martin-magakian/Amazing-Cloud-Search "Title"), and slightly changed to work.

Main addition is facets, and removing facetConstraints which no longer exists in the 2013 API.
Querybuilder has been modified a bit as well.

More changes to come.
